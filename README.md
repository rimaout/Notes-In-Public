# Notes In Public

This is the repository that I use to deploy a [Quartz](https://github.com/jackyzha0/quartz)-based site for _**Notes In Public**_, my personal collection of Markdown notes. I use these notes to write down everything I learn, from university notes to documentation for some of my projects.

You can find the site at [notesinpublic.xyz](https://notesinpublic.xyz) and the repository where I store the Markdown notes themselves [here](https://github.com/rimaout/Obsidian-Vault).
